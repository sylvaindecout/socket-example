# socket-example
Example of a socket with:
 - Netty for client-server communication
 - Google Protocol Buffers for optimized data serialization

## Test case
On start-up, client sends _login request_. It keeps trying until it is accepted (_login response_ message).
Server sends _data update_ messages to all logged clients, according to a test scenario defined in **Simulation** class.
Client logs content of every data update it receives.

## Generated data model
Classes generated by Protobuf are not committed to source repository, as they are generated on every build. 

_Prerequisite_: Protobuf has to be installed (https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) and accessible in PATH of the server that builds the project.

## How to run

 - Start Application in *socket-server*
 - Start Application in *socket-client*
 - Check logs in console
 - Access metrics from JMX console
